📝 Project Overview: YahooMessenger - Reimagined
This project is a modern, feature-rich real-time chat application inspired by the classic Yahoo Messenger, built from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript on the frontend and Node.js (Express) with MongoDB on the backend.

It supports user registration and login, private and group chats, and modern messaging features like read receipts, image/file sharing, online/offline status, and even message forwarding and deletion, all powered by Socket.io for real-time communication.

The goal was to create a secure, dynamic, and interactive messaging platform that feels nostalgic like Yahoo Messenger, but functions with modern-day expectations in chat apps.
